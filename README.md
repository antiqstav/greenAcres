## The theme statement and our solution
According to the TSA "Themes and Problems" page, this year's problem statement is as follows:
> Develop a program that enhances the environment and/or agriculture to be more sustainable and efficient.

We use the user's geographical location, receive agricultural and environmental data about the area, and receive a prediction from an AI model based on that input.
